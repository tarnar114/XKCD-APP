# XKCD-APP

This was a an app i made for a case study for a company called Stratus360. The case study involved a situation where we had to develop a app with an api, fetch that data and then
try to use that API and develop an app from it. In this case it was https://xkcd.com. My problem involved fetching from their respective API and almost create a clone of it.
I decided to use Node.js and Express as my main backend frameworks and handlebars as a template engine. I also decided to host it on heroku just as a quick and easy way to host
it (https://xkcd-comic-tanzir.herokuapp.com). This was a simple app but a nice app to program none the less.
